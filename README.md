# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-using-Javascript
The game is played on a 3x3 grid and players take turns marking their X or O on a square of the grid. The code uses event listeners to detect when the user clicks on a square and displays their X or O accordingly.

Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
